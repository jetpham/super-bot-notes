## first stage
- robot should be able to calculate a rpm for the robot from any position on the field that the robot can shoot from
- this would aolso include calculatoins for the adjustable shooter hood if aplicable.
## second stage
- robot is able to calculate and understand the velocity, angular velocity, heading, and positoin of the robot. This is able to be done using the visoin and the odometry
## third stage
- we should be able to calculate a trajectory for the ball while taking into account the time it will take for the ball to be shot aswell as the velocity, angular velocity, heading, and position of the robot. 
- the output of sotm should give a angle and rpm for the shooter should be at
## fourth stage
- the robot should now be able to get to the angles and rpms that the shoot on the move command is requesting. it is important to note that shoot on the move only will control the turret angle and the rpm of the flywheel. This allows the drivers to still have full control of when the robot will shoot as well as give the ability for the robot to shoot rapid fire and single shot.
