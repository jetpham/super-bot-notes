It is important to note that for sotm, we are going to be continuously calculating the desired path of the ball and then from that find the angle and rpm that we want to shoot at.

Balls will always travel in a parabola due to gravity, we can use this to calculate what trajectory we would need to get a good shot into the upper hub.
