The philosophies of the softawre for swerve drive should be that this is based off of math entirely and is abstracte dto a high point
Using a Library such as Jscience will make our lives easier with vector manipulation
we can also make our own classes for vector manipulatoin when it comes to voltages, translateiongs and velocities. 

Each module will be able to be given an angle and velocity and the module should be able to handle the processing to convert those into voltages and the acceleratoins to get to those points

The robot as a whole should be able to be given a position and rotation relative to itself & be able to calculate the optimal path for the robot's swerve modules to follow to get to that position

The robot should be able to be given a position and rotation relative to a global axis (the field) and be able ot translate that into a relative positoin and rotatoin to itself

The robot should be able to keep track of where it is relative to a global plane using it's encoders
